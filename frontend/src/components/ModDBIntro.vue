<p>
This document is designed to help the members of the AIM SWGOH guild with 
modding of the teams. SWGOH is divided into groups of events. 
Some of 
these events are always present, some events are guild driven, and other 
events are started by the game. Within each event category, there are 
specific events that allow players to interact with other players or the 
game. Players interact via teams.</p>
<p>
Teams in SWGOH are comprised of different characters which can be obtained 
via shards earned via game play. Characters gain attributes such as speed 
and health by increasing the type of gear they own.</p>
<p>
Along with the gear, characters can increase their attributes via mods. 
Unlike gear, mods can be added or removed from characters at will. Hence, 
the use of mods allow players to fine-tune the strengths of their characters.</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, there many sources of mod suggestions. Players are often 
overwhelmed by these choices and this document will try to tabulate some of 
the more common mod suggestions.</p>
<p>
To use this document, simply select the event category that you are 
interested in and the subsequent event. For each event there can be one or 
more possible teams. Select your team of interest, and you should find a 
table for each character on the team. The table shows a series of mod 
options. From here the player can decide how they want to mix and match 
their mods.</p>
<p>
This document is a work in progress. If you find something wrong, a missing 
team that you use, or a set of mod suggestions that worked for you, but 
aren't tabulated, please let us know in the Discord channel.</p>
