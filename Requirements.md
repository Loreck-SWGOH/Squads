# Introduction

This document lays out the requirements for an application that helps users to
define different SWGOH team mods. SWGOH id divided into groups of events. 
Some of these events are always present, some events are guild driven, and other 
events are started by the game. Within each event category, there are 
specific events that allow players to interact with other players or the 
game. Players interact via teams.

Teams in SWGOH are comprised of different characters which can be obtained 
via shards earned via game play. All characters have a series of attributes,
such as speed and health that are used in game play to define both attacks and
defense against attacks. Characters increase these attributes applying different
types of gears and different types of mods.

Application of gear to a character allows a character to reach different gear
levels with different increases in attributes for each character. Gear levels
are numbered one (1) to thirteen (13). Past gear level 13 (G13) characters can
be equipped with relics that are numbered one to nine (9).

Along with the gear and relics, characters can increase their attributes via mods. 
Unlike gear, mods can be added or removed from characters at will. Hence, 
the use of mods allow players to fine-tune the strengths of their characters.

Each character can have six different mods applied, denoted by their shape.
The six types are square, arrow, diamond, triangle, circle, and cross. Each type
of mod is part of a mod set, health, defense, critical chance, critical damage,
tenacity, offense, potency, and speed. Mods also have a primary stat and four
secondary stats.

The primary stats are accuracy, critical avoidance, critical
chance, critical damage, defense, health, offense, potency, protection, speed,
and tenacity. Secondary stats can be critical chance, flat defense, defense,
flat health, health, flat offense, offense, potency, flat protection, protection,
speed, and tenacity.

The primary and secondary stats are affected by the mod rarity, the mod level,
and the mod tier. The rarity of a mod cannot be changed, but the mod level and 
the mod tier can be increased. Mod levels range from level one (1) to level
fifteen (15). Mod tiers increase from tier E, the lowest, to tier A, the highest.
Increasing a mod's level or its tier causes primary stats and random secondary
stats to increase.

Mod suggestions can be found from a variety of sources. Unfortunately, there many 
sources of mod suggestions. Players are often 
overwhelmed by these choices and this document will try to tabulate some of 
the more common mod suggestions.

To use this document, simply select the event category that you are 
interested in and the subsequent event. For each event there can be one or 
more possible teams. Select your team of interest, and you should find a 
table for each character on the team. The table shows a series of mod 
options. From here the player can decide how they want to mix and match 
their mods.

This document is a work in progress. If you find something wrong, a missing 
team that you use, or a set of mod suggestions that worked for you, but 
aren't tabulated, please let us know in the Discord channel.
