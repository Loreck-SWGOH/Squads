# Territory War (TW) Teams

[Back to Events](../README.md)

Territory Wars are a guild versus guild event. Each guild controls an area 
comprised on a number of zones. There are two main phases, set-up and 
offense. During the set-up phase each guild places defense teams into the 
different zones of its area. During the offense phase each guild tries to clear 
zones in the opposing area by choosing teams to battle against the 
previously placed defensive teams. At the start of the offensive phase only 
the front zones are open for attack. Other zones become open for attack when 
adjacent zones are cleared. Characters used in defensive teams and offensive 
teams are mutually exclusive, requiring that guilds balance the 
effectiveness between the teams.
